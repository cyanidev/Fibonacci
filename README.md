The function f calculates the nth number in the sequence where:

f(1) returns 1
For n > 1, it returns the sum of the previous two values in the sequence, similar to Fibonacci but with a static variable to store the previous result.

### Usage

Clone the repository and compile with `make`. To run the program:

```
./Fibonacci <positive integer>
```
